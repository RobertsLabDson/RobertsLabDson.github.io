## Research in the Roberts lab is focused on AML and the Gene Regulatory Network behind the disease.

### Why do we do what we do?

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, and is also seen in children (1). In the United States, AML is the leading cause of death from leukemia, with over 20,000 new diagnoses and 10,000 deaths annually (2). Like most cancers of a particular tissue type, there are multiple subtypes of AML defined by cytological, genetic and clinical criteria. All AML subtypes have a limited number of recurrent oncogenic driver mutations, but no one driver mutation is shared by all AMLs, in fact the most common recurrent gene mutation, NPM1, is observed in only a third of AML patients (3). The focus of our lab is not on these well-defined oncogenic driver mutations, but rather on the transcriptomes they produce. If an AML cell harbors 10 oncogenic gene mutations, this means that the remaining ~20,000 genes are normal. So why is a leukemia cell so different from the normal hematopoietic progenitor from which it was derived? The answer is in the types, forms, amounts, and locations of proteins and regulatory RNAs produced, directed by the transcriptome. Indeed, AML subtypes can be defined by gene expression signatures of normal genes that are differentially expressed in the cancer cells (4). We seek to understand which genes most impact the complex cancer phenotype and are predictive of clinical outcome. By identifying these key genes, we hope to define novel therapeutic targets for directed drug intervention.

### Our Model System: The Phorbol Ester Response Of AML Cell Lines

Several AML cell lines have been established, which show the capacity to undergo myeloid differentiation in response to chemical inducers that activate signaling pathways leading to changes in the transcriptome (5). Phorbol esters irreversibly activate PKC in AML cell lines like HL-60, enabling signaling systems that genetically reprogram the cells to undergo cell cycle arrest, macrophage-like differentiation, and apoptosis (6). We have determined changes in gene expression at the transcriptional level in HL-60 cells treated with PMA for various times (0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 hours) by DNA microarray analysis (7). These studies have identified ~1,250 genes that are significantly (>2-fold) up- or down-regulated at two or more time points. The ability to provoke cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis by altering the transcriptome, suggests that gene expression reprogramming can override oncogenic mutations in clinically relevant ways. We hope to understand the key genes and mechanisms involved in the reversion of acute myeloid leukemia cells into cells that have regained the capacities for proliferative control, myeloid differentiation, and apoptosis.

To this end, we are exploring the function of specific PMA-responsive genes in HL-60 cells by individually over-expressing or knocking down the expression of genes hypothesized to contribute to the phenotypic changes of interest through transfection experiments. Our focus in understanding PMA-induced reprogramming is on those genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), with the rationale that the differential expression of a few TF genes could be driving the expression changes of many/most of the genes of the PMA response. Perhaps, changing the expression of key TF genes results in the up- or down-regulation of genes that affect cell cycle arrest, and/or macrophage differentiation, and/or apoptosis. The transfection experiments in progress involve confirmation of over-expression or knockdown by RT-qPCR (for RNA level changes) and Western blotting (for protein level changes).
