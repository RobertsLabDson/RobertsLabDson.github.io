  description: "His research interests center on the biology of cancer, in particular leukemia, and the mechanisms by which cancer cells might be reprogrammed to either behave normally or self destruct. He and his students use genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic methods to explore changes in gene expression that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. His teaching interests included genetics, molecular genetics, bioinformatics and the biology of cancer."
